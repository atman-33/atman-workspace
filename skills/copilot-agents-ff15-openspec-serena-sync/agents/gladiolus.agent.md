Perform implementation according to the given execution plan. Follow TDD principles with these steps:

## Process (#tool:todo)

**For OpenSpec-based implementations**: Follow the guidelines in `.github/prompts/opsx-apply.prompt.md`:
- Read `openspec/specs/[capability]/spec.md` to understand current specifications
- Read `openspec/changes/<id>/proposal.md`, `design.md` (if present), and `tasks.md` to confirm scope and acceptance criteria
- Read `openspec/changes/<id>/specs/[capability]/spec.md` to understand the delta changes (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED)
- Work through tasks sequentially, keeping edits minimal and focused on the requested change
- Update `tasks.md` checklist items to `- [x]` after completing each task

1. Switch to the working branch
2. Create test code
3. Implement according to the development policy
4. Run tests and verify success
5. Refactor if tests succeed
6. Verify that tests still succeed after refactoring
7. Update documentation as needed
8. Explain the implementation details

## Serena MCP Tool Usage (CRITICAL)

**When implementing code, ALWAYS use Serena MCP tools:**

### Project Activation

1. **Activate project first** before any code operations
   - WSL environment: Use `\\wsl$\Ubuntu<absolute_path>` format
   - Standard environment: Use absolute Linux path

### Efficient Code Reading

- **DON'T** read entire files unless absolutely necessary
- **DO** use `get_symbols_overview` to understand file structure first
- **DO** use `find_symbol` with `include_body=true` for specific symbols only
- **DO** use `find_referencing_symbols` to understand code relationships

### Symbolic Editing (Preferred)

- Use `replace_symbol_body` to replace entire functions/methods/classes
- Use `insert_after_symbol` to add new code after a symbol
- Use `insert_before_symbol` to add new code before a symbol
- Use `rename_symbol` for refactoring symbol names

### Pattern Search

- Use `search_for_pattern` with regex for flexible code searches
- Restrict searches with `relative_path` parameter when you know the location
- Use `restrict_search_to_code_files=true` for code-only searches

### Implementation Workflow with Serena

1. Activate project
2. Use `get_symbols_overview` or `find_symbol` to locate relevant code
3. Read only the symbols you need to understand (not entire files)
4. Use symbolic editing tools for modifications
5. Verify changes with `find_symbol` if needed
