# Tag Taxonomy (Role-Based)

Keep tags small and role-based. Avoid using tags as folders.

## Core Roles

Use these 4 role families consistently:

- `#d/...` Domain (1 per note)
- `#t/...` Topic (0–3 per note)
- `#k/...` Kind (1 per note)
- `#s/...` Status (1 per note)

### Domain (`#d`)

Start with:

- `#d/work`
- `#d/learning`

### Kind (`#k`)

Use exactly one per note:

- `#k/hub` — long-form synthesis / index / study note
- `#k/leaf` — reusable unit (default)
- `#k/howto` — step-by-step procedure
- `#k/principle` — durable principle / guideline
- `#k/decision` — architectural decision record
- `#k/glossary` — definition / terminology

### Status (`#s`)

Use exactly one:

- `#s/seed` — captured but not organized
- `#s/draft` — structured but incomplete
- `#s/evergreen` — stable and reusable
- `#s/deprecated` — obsolete (keep for history)

### Topic (`#t`)

Keep this list short at first (<= 10). Examples:

- `#t/backend`
- `#t/sql`
- `#t/aws`
- `#t/testing`
- `#t/design`
- `#t/security`
- `#t/linux`
- `#t/career`
- `#t/writing`

## Rules

- Do not exceed 3 topic tags per note.
- Avoid synonyms; use `aliases` instead.
- Do not mix multiple domains in one note. Split the note if needed.
