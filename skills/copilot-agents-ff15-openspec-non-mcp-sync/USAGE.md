# FF15 Copilot Agents - OpenSpec Edition - Usage Guide

This guide explains how to effectively use the FF15 OpenSpec agents in GitHub Copilot.

## Overview

FF15 OpenSpec agents provide a specification-driven development workflow based on the [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) framework. OpenSpec is a lightweight specification management tool for AI-assisted coding that enables predictable and auditable development by establishing agreement on specifications between humans and AI before implementation.

This agent team creates OpenSpec documents (proposal, tasks, design) and autonomously handles implementation, quality improvement, documentation, and PR creation based on those specifications.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using FF15 OpenSpec agents, you need the following environment:

- **Node.js** >= 20.19.0 (check with `node --version`)
- **GitHub Copilot** (VS Code or compatible editor)
- **OpenSpec CLI** (setup in the following section)
- **Git** (for version control and PR creation)

---

## OpenSpec Setup

### Step 1: Install OpenSpec CLI

**Option A: Install via npm**

```bash
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest
```

Confirm installation:

```bash
openspec --version
```

**Option B: Install via Nix (when using NixOS or Nix package manager)**

Run directly (no installation required):

```bash
nix run github:Fission-AI/OpenSpec -- init
```

Install to profile:

```bash
nix profile install github:Fission-AI/OpenSpec
```

### Step 2: Initialize Project

Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd your-project
```

Initialize OpenSpec:

```bash
openspec init
```

The initialization process will:
- Prompt you to select the AI tool you're using (Claude Code, Cursor, Qoder, etc.)
- Automatically configure slash commands for the selected tool
- Create `AGENTS.md` in the project root
- Create the `openspec/` directory structure

**Important**: After initialization, restart your AI assistant to enable slash commands.

### Step 3: Configure Project Context (Optional)

After initialization, configure project-specific information:

```bash
# Ask AI assistant:
"Please read openspec/project.md and help me fill it out with details about my project, tech stack, and conventions"
```

In `openspec/project.md`, document conventions, architectural patterns, coding standards, etc. that should be followed throughout the project.

### Step 4: Verify Setup

Confirm the setup is correct:

```bash
openspec list
```

This command displays active change folders (initially empty).

## Philosophy First

FF15 OpenSpec agents focus on **autonomous execution with minimal interruptions**. They operate with a clear specification-driven process:
- **Specifications are paramount** through OpenSpec documents
- **User intervention is minimal** (approval + verification only)
- **Quality is built-in** through autonomous review and improvement
- **Documentation is continuous** throughout the workflow

---

## Quick Start

### Start with Noctis

Most tasks begin with **Noctis**:

```
/noctis Add shopping cart functionality
/noctis Refactor authentication module
/noctis Add real-time notifications
```

Noctis will:
1. Collaborate with you to create OpenSpec documents (proposal, tasks, design)
2. Request specification approval
3. Optionally delegate Issue creation to Iris
4. Delegate implementation to Gladiolus
5. Delegate code quality improvement to Prompto
6. Delegate documentation updates to Ignis (without archiving)
7. Verify task completion and archive OpenSpec
8. Delegate PR creation to Lunafreya
9. Notify with PR link for final verification

   Manages            Builds based         Reviews and         Updates           Creates
   GitHub             on OpenSpec          refines           documentation       pull
   Issues             specifications       quality                              requests

- **Motivation**: Why are we building it?
- **Approach**: How will we build it?
- **Scope**: What's included and what's excluded?

### tasks.md
- **Checklist**: Step-by-step implementation tasks
- **Progress tracking**: Mark completed items
- **Dependencies**: Task ordering

### design.md
- **Technical design**: Detailed implementation plan
- **Architecture**: System structure
- **API contracts**: Interfaces and data models
- **Edge cases**: Error handling and validation

---

**Remember**: Specification-driven development with autonomous execution and minimal user interruption.
